           <h1>Winter Facts</h1> 
            <p>Winter is the coldest season. It snows in many places during the winter. We change our lifestyle to live comfortably in winter. We try to insulate our bodies with coats to keep our bodies warm. Many people enjoy drinking coffee and cocoa in the winter. The nights of the winter are longer than a day, so you would think you would get more sleep, however school ruins that. Many animals migrate from one place to other to reach the warmer areas, and some hybernate for the entire season, something many humans get jealous of.</p>
            <h4>Why Winter is the Worst</h4>
