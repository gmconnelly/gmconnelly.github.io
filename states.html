        <p>The best website is <a href="https://www.vermont.gov">Vermont</a>. The website is visually appealing, and easy to navigate. It is easy access and loads quickly. There are many pictures and tabs to click on to access information. It has many important services and tabs to take you where you want to go. It works on multiple screen sizes making it versital. I like how the backgrounds they use are images and anre interactive. </p>

    <div>
        <p>The second best website was <a href="https://www.tn.gov">Tennessee</a>. This website was easy to access, loaded quickly, and had lots of information. It comes in a close second to Vermont's website. The tabs make it easy to access what you want to find. A rotating homescreen lets you view things you might be interested and draws you into the site. They have many links to other spots on the site to find more information on what you might be looking for.

    <div>
        <p>Next is <a href="https://www.iowa.gov">Iowa</a>. The site loads a little slower than the previous two, and was kind of glitchy. The menu was easy to access, but could have used more description of the tabs. The website is a little too busy which made finding links harder. It is accessible on different screen sizes and had a lot of information if you look.
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>After this comes<a href="https://www.ok.gov"> Oaklahoma</a>, this site was not visually appealing. It looked like any other government website. The website took a while to load, and was hard to find links. It looks old and not user friendly, it also did not have as many recources as the previous websites. It is however accessable from multiple screen sizes. The site was somewhat confusing and not very interesting to look at. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Finally comes <a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a>. This website is not compatable with smartphones. In addition it is not visually appealing and it loads very slow. The website is confusing and it is hard to find what you're looking for. The website is really busy so it distracts your from what you are looking for. Overall it is the least appealing website out of the five.</p>
