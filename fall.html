            <h1>Autumn Facts</h1>
            <p> Autumn is the conversion period between the summer and the winter. This season arrives as the summer ends. The temperature starts to drop until winter arrives, the saddest time of the year. Leaves of the trees fall and change their color to pale yellow, offten considered the prettiest time of the year it should also be considered the most depressing. All of the beauty and warmth of summer is covered up with multiple feet of snow and dissapears for basically seven months if you're a die hard Montanan.</p>
            <p1>Fall is also a time where many school aged children are forced to go sit in classrooms for eight hours a day to learn how to add numbers and read words; typical everyday skills that you will use for the rest of your life. However this important part of every childs life only lasts 12-16 years so in retrospect, only a fraction of a lifetime. </p1>
