            <h2>Good Websites</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.swiss.com/worldofswiss/en/#" class="swiss">Swiss Airlines</a></h3>
            <p1>Normally looking at an airlines website you wouldn’t think that it would be very inspiring, but the Swiss Airlines site was one that really stood out to me. The layout is simple in a two or three column style for most pages, made mostly of pictures, there is white space that is placed nicely to make it more appealing to the eyes. The pictures also alternate in size to break them up so they don’t look like a big block. As for the menu it is very simple but has a professional look to it because the layout is simple and it is easy to find what you are looking for. They also only use neutral colors and one pop of red to create a simplistic site. All of the pages load quickly and have a lot of information but it doesn’t look crowded.
            </p1>
            <p2>The coding of the website is a little more difficult to understand than the Feedmusic site, I’m assuming this is because it has so much more information. The source code has a lot of script elements and I’m not sure what exactly that does but it makes the website look good. They also use div and link elements for most of it to create a connection to other pages with more information. All of their buttons have features making them light up in a red or they get bigger, the site has so much on it because it allows users to access thousands of locations, ways to book flights, hotels, rental cars, and much more. I think this site works really well and is pleasing to the eye, making it one of my top great websites.

            <h3><a href="http://www.feedmusic.com/#/" class="feed">Feedmusic</a></h3>
            <p1>The site looks really unique and is interactive, it has an atmosphere no other website has. There are pictures and words constantly moving but not so much that they are distracting or overwhelming. When you scroll there is something new that pops up each time with new information and a unique design to go along with the text. The menu is easy to follow and the site loads fast. Even their meeting scheduling page is different from most sites; it offers a fill in the blank paragraph like space rather than a boring form you would typically see on any other website. They also have interesting buttons that when you hover over them they change shapes, sizes and colors all making the entire webpage very eye-catching. The layout was in a one column style but it made the site more interesting to look at. All of the colors were very simplistic, bright, powerful colors that made the site stand out from the page. The site also had a simple white border around the whole page but it separated it from the screen and made it pop out.</p1>
            <p2>Surprisingly, the coding of the website was much more simple than I expected. The script was made up of meta, div, and link elements mostly but they added the motion and designs that made the whole site look so clean. The only two elements I had not seen before were the “span”, and “active” elements, and I’m assuming this is what made the text and pictures move across the page.In all honesty the site doesn’t look that hard to build, but the simplicity and unique factors it has are what make me believe it is a really good website.</p2>
            <h2>Bad Websites</h2>
            <h3><a href="http://www.arngren.net" class="arn">Arngren</a></h3>
            <p1>The website is a sales website or some sort, it has add squares of different types of items such as cars, light bulbs, and walkie talkies. None of the items are in any order and take up the whole page with no breaks. Instead of having the page scroll just up and down, it also scrolls left to right so in order to see the whole thing you have to move around the site in every direction. The site is not mobile friendly and overall is just an eye sore. There are moving gifs everywhere some have a Christmas theme in common but mostly just a mash of random shapes, colors, and designs. There is an index, but there is no logical order and it does not have every item on it. It is just as difficult to navigate the index as it is the rest of the site. None of the text matched, all different fonts, sizes, colors, and boldness, which made it more distracting to look at.
            </p1>
            <p2>The source code is made of mostly meta and div elements and it has no organization or line elements or anything to keep the page in order. Most of the code is filled with an image attached to a link but a lot of the links don’t work, so when you click on an image to potentially purchase the item an error code comes up and there is no way to access the item. Other items open into another page with random pictures and messy elements that have more links that don’t work. The website has inconsistent font and colors and is hard to look at.</p2>
